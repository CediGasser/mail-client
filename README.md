# A mail client written in rust and svelte

Nothing ground-breaking, just a mail client.

EMail is a solved problem. This mail client doesn't try to introduce some crazy new way for you to work with email. It attempts to make your email experience more enjoyable with aestetic design and good UX.

But currently, it's not yet usable at all :)

## Development

You'll need:

- [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Then, install the dependencies with: `npm install`

and start the development server using: `npm run tauri dev`

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).
